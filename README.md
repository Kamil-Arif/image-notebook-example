# Image in Notebook Example
## To get the correct image link
Usually, GitHub is able to handle relative links within repositories. For example, I can link the image in this file:
![local path test](image.png)
However this doesn't work in Notebooks for some reason, so you need to link to the image from GitHub's CDN, rather than a local file.
